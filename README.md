# Project Auth API
This week's project is related to our final project. It comprises two integral parts: the backend API and the React frontend. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, incorporates industry best practices for secure user authentication. MongoDB (or any preferred database) is utilized for persistent data storage. On the frontend, React, coupled with Zustand, orchestrates an intuitive user interface. 


## Key Challenges and Objectives
The key challenges of this week's project is to understadn all new concepts. 
1. Hashing and Salting:The project addresses the critical challenge of ensuring the confidentiality of user passwords through advanced techniques such as hashing and salting, fortifying the security of stored credentials.
2. JSON Web Token (JWT): Efficient and secure communication between the frontend and backend is achieved through the implementation of JWTs. These tokens facilitate user session management, enhancing the overall user experience. 
3. Middleware for User Authentication: Middleware functions are implemented to authenticate users, safeguarding API endpoints. This ensures that only authorized users gain access to protected routes, contributing to a secure and controlled environment.
