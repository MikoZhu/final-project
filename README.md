# Project Auth API
This week's project is related to our final project. It comprises two integral parts: the backend API and the React frontend. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, incorporates industry best practices for secure user authentication. MongoDB (or any preferred database) is utilized for persistent data storage. On the frontend, React, coupled with Zustand, orchestrates an intuitive user interface.
